Adding a new quiz
1. Make a copy of TEMPLATE.json from the quizzes folder.

2. Replace information inside "quizInfo".

3. Paste the data of the quiz inside "quizData".

4. Save and rename the file as follows "C2_S2_" + Subject abbreviation + "_" + Grading period + "_" + Number of the quiz in that grading period + ".json".
- Example: If the quiz is the 3rd quiz for the Finals period of subject Integrative Programming, the file name would be "C2_S2_IP_Finals_3.json".

5. Open "SAP-Subject-Manifest.json" and add an entry of your quiz in the appropriate place.

6. Set "Subfolder_ID" to the file name of your quiz. (This does nothing but it's good to keep track of the files.
- Example: From the previous example, the Subfolder_ID would be "C2_S2_IP_Finals_3".

7. Set "Subfolder_Link" to "quizPlayer.html?Quiz=" + file name of your quiz minus .json. Make sure it is the same as the file name of your actual quiz file.
- Example: From the previous example, the Subfolder_Link would be "quizPlayer.html?Quiz=C2_S2_IP_Finals_3".

8. Refresh SAP and check if the quiz loads properly. If not, check if everything is done correctly. If it still doesn't work, please contact Elmer dahil pakana nya to hahaha
